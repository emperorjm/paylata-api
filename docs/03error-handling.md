# Error Handling

In order to handle API errors gracefully, exceptions are thrown when errors occur which will return an error response with the relevant error code and message, for example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": 422,
    "message": "The given data was invalid"
  }
}
```

The status codes that may be returned from the API are detailed below:

| Status Code | Description                                                                                 |
